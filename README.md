# Weather App

[Live Demo](https://taylorjonestrt.github.io/weather-app/)



For my first project to utilize using an API I created a weather app that will grab your locations (or any locations) current weather details (Current temperature, what it actually feels like outside, a description and more).



While building the web app I focused on having every function/method be aligned with the single-responsibility principle as much as possible (may have been able to do it in other places as well, if I missed any open an issue to point it out!).
